# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Mushrooms Dataset using R
This is a repository for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted on the Mushrooms dataset using R. The main goal of this project is to gain insights and knowledge from the data by analyzing and visualizing various aspects of the dataset, as cap color, odor, stalk surface above ring, and others. The dataset is used to classify mushrooms into 2 classes, namely edible or poisonous based on the characteristics given in the dataset.

The repository includes a PDF file explaining the EDA process and findings, an R script file containing the code used to perform the analysis, plots in PNG format, and insights gained from the EDA.

**Insights:**

*	mushrooms dataset is a dataset that displays characteristics about mushrooms such as cap.color, odor, stalk.surface.above.ring, and others. This dataset is used to classify mushrooms into 2 classes, namely edible or poisonous based on the characteristics given in the dataset
*	Our dataset consists of 8124 rows and 23 columns
*	All variables in our dataset are categorical data (data type = char)
*	Missing value in our dataset represent by “?”
*	Our dataset has 2480 missing value in stalk.root column and doesn’t has any duplicated rows
*	In our dataset, there are more edible mushrooms than poisonous ones
*	The variable that is highly correlated with class is odor, while the stalk surface above and below the ring is fairly correlated with class
